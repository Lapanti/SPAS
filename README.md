School project for showing a weekly calendar view of your courses.

Current version (0.2) features:
User login/register system.
Course searching.
Course saving.
Course group selecting.
iCalendar making.

It will ultimately take all the information needed for displaying a smart-looking calendar view from our school's (Aalto University) system, that provides a GET-based interface.
You will be able to login/register and then save courses you intend to take and it will form the view from those.
