School project for showing a weekly calendar view of your courses (at the moment only makes an iCalendar, due to iCalendar-reading softwares are amany).

Current version (1.0) features:<br/>
- User login/register system.<br/>
- Course searching.<br/>
- Course saving.<br/>
- Course group selecting.<br/>
- iCalendar making.

It will ultimately take all the information needed for displaying a smart-looking calendar view from our school's (Aalto University) system, that provides a GET-based interface.
You will be able to login/register and then save courses you intend to take and it will form the view from those.
